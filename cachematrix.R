## a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inversematrix <- NULL           # empty storage for inversematrix 
        # store inversematrix after solve calculation
        
        reset <- function(){ inversematrix <- NULL }
        
        
}


## computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        
        inversematrix <- solve(x)
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
